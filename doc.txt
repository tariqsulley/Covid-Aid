a. Objective: To build a user friendly Covid-19 app that can be used for contact tracing by anonymously tracking the users’ location, 
provide diagnostic services, provide updates on Ghana’s Covid-19 cases, and give the user a holistic view of what Covid-19 and information he/she has to know about it.

b. Methodology: I plan to build this app using React Native which is an open source mobile application framework created by Facebook.
It uses JavaScript as its programming language. I will also create a representational state transfer application programming interface that 
I will build with Node.js( an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side) and Express.js (a backend web application framework for Node.js) 
to enable users who test positive for Covid-19 send their location data to a server for this data then to be sent to everyone who has the app for some calculations to be 
performed to see if you have ever come into contact with the Covid-19 patient for you to be able to take the necessary precautions to the minimize the spread of the virus.
